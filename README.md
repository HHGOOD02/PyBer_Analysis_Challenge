# PyBer_Analysis_Challenge
Further analyzing rideshare usage data to determine metatrends

## Overview
The goal of this analysis is to compile rider and ride metadata, and to then stratify it by the type of settlement they occur in (Rural, Suburban, Urban). This, nominally, will allow us to view macro-trends present in rider data and allow us to better make future decisions.

## Analysis
Throughout the data, we can see clear trends in a multitude of categories. The average price for Rural rides is notably higher than those of Suburban and - even moreso - Urban rides. We are also able to see that Urban ridership and revanue is by far the largest portion of our ride data.
By stratifying the data this, we can conclude that ridership and ride prices are clearly correlated.

## Conclusion
Contrary to what some may say, there is likely no problem occurring. Individuals who reside in Rural parts of the country are more likely to have their own
individual transportation; and are equally unlikely to partake in ride-sharing app usage. This necessarily deflates the number of rides we see in Rural areas,
which will in turn result in less individuals signing up to be drivers, which ultimately results in supply and demand evening out at a higher per-ride price than in Urban regions.
As a result of this, it is likely a profitable course of action to offer small incentives to Rural regions to drive for PyBer; and to offer deals for taking PyBer rides in order to 
generate a growing rider-base. By doing so, we will be able to marginally (but definitively) increase our revanue in these regions, but will not be exhausting our capital supply
in attempting to reverse an inevitable trend of lower ridership in Rural regions.
